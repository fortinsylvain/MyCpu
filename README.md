# Homebrew CPU Project (74LS Logic + EEPROM)

I built this CPU at home using 74LS logic ICs and EEPROMs, driven by curiosity and a desire to understand processor design at a fundamental level.

---

## ðŸ”§ Project Overview
My goal was to create a **fully functional CPU** using a **1-bit ALU**. While this results in relatively slow execution speeds, it allows me to explore the control and datapath mechanisms in detail.

- All **microcode** for the CPU is stored in **two binary files** programmed into 2864 EEPROM chips.
- A custom **microassembler** generates these micro-instructions.

## ðŸ§µ Wire-Wrap Prototype

Before moving to a PCB, I built a **wire-wrap prototype** to test the design on real hardware. This stage was essential for debugging the microcode, verifying timing, and refining the instruction set.

Wire-wrapping made it easier to make changes during development while still providing a reliable and compact way to interconnect components.

## ðŸ§  Custom CPU PCB Update

With the core architecture proven on the wire-wrap prototypes, the **custom PCB version** of the CPU is now complete. This phase of the project has been generously sponsored by [**PCBWay**](https://www.pcbway.com).

I was really impressed by PCBWayâ€™s **one-click KiCad integration** â€” all design files were submitted automatically to the PCBWay factory with a single click. The ordering process was fast and seamless!

Hereâ€™s a snapshot of the completed KiCad design:

Stay tuned for updates â€” the full PCB layout will be shared as the project progresses!

## ðŸ—‚ Microcode and Assembler

- Microcode source: `uCodeAssembler/`
- Opcode assembler: `opCodeAssembler/`
- Diagnostic program: `opCodeAssembler/examples/diag.asm`

## ðŸ§  Register Implementation on RAM

The design uses address-mapped RAM to support the CPUâ€™s operation. This approach saves chip count, though at the cost of execution speed.

The following registers are implemented in RAM:
- Instruction Pointer
- Register A
- Carry Flag
- Equal Flag
- Index Register
- Stack Pointer
- The Stack

Here is the memory address map:

0000H - 17FFH Total RAM space
-----------------------------
* 0000H - 17FFH Total RAM space
* 0000H - 00FFH Stack
* 0100H - 17EF  Free for application
* 1FF0H SP      Stack Pointer 8 bit
* 1FF1H JSH     Temporary storage for JSR MSB address
* 1FF2H JSL          "       "     "   "  LSB    "
* 1FF3H XH      Index Register MSB
* 1FF4H XL      Index Register LSB
* 1FFAH E       bit<0> Equal Status bit
* 1FFBH C       bit<0> Carry Status bit
* 1FFCH A       Register
* 1FFEH IPH	    Instruction Pointer MSB
* 1FFFH IPL     Instruction Pointer MSB
* C000H         LED port
* E000H - F000H EEPROM for application program

## Microcode and Control ROMs

The ROM decoding table encodes how data moves between components.  
This reduces the number of control bits required by expanding microcode control using external PROMs.

- ROM chips: **IC20** and **IC21** (74S188, 256Ã—1 Open Collector PROMs)
- These are *one-time programmable* PROMs.
- Several chips were sacrificed before the correct decoding table was finalized.

## I/O Board Schematic

Includes:
- RAM
- EEPROM (for application program)
- LEDs for visual feedback

## Debugging Setup

Early debugging involved **single clock stepping** and LEDs to display microcode address and main bus data.  
This was quickly found to be too tedious, leading to the acquisition of an **Agilent 1670G Logic Analyzer** (eBay bargain!).

- Logic analyzer connected to **MyCpu**
- Allows recording of instruction traces
- Symbol assignment enables **rudimentary microcode disassembly**
