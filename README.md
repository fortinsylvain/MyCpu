# Homebrew CPU Project

I built this CPU at home using 74LS logic ICs, EEPROMs, RAMs and GALs, driven by curiosity and a desire to understand processor design at a fundamental level.

## üîß Project Overview
My goal was to create a **fully functional CPU** using a **1-bit ALU**. While this results in relatively slow execution speeds, it allows me to explore the control and datapath mechanisms in detail.

- All **microcode** for the CPU is stored in **two binary files** programmed into 2864 EEPROM chips.
- A custom **microassembler** generates these micro-instructions.

## üß† Custom CPU PCB Update

With the core architecture proven on the wire-wrap prototypes, the custom PCB version of the CPU is now complete. This phase of the project has been generously sponsored by PCBWay.

A special thank you to Liam from the Marketing Department at PCBWay, who discovered the wire-wrap prototype on GitHub and kindly offered sponsorship to support the development of a fully professional PCB.

üõ†Ô∏è PCBWay Manufacturing Review
I‚Äôm happy to share my experience working with PCBWay for manufacturing the custom PCB version of my CPU project. Here's a quick summary of how it went:

First, I transferred the handwritten schematic into KiCad, then completed the routing for each required part. I was able to find all the necessary components on AliExpress. After carefully checking my Gerber files, it was time to send the design to the factory.

üîÅ I was genuinely impressed by PCBWay‚Äôs one-click KiCad integration ‚Äî all design files were submitted automatically to the PCBWay factory with a single click. No file packaging, no ZIP uploads ‚Äî just click and go! The ordering process was fast and seamless.

üåê The web interface was intuitive and transparent, allowing me to track each step of the production process in real time.

üì¶ The PCBs arrived astonishingly quickly, properly boxed and well-protected with excellent packaging.

üõí Although I ordered 5 PCBs, they kindly included 6 boards in the shipment ‚Äî a thoughtful bonus!

üåç There‚Äôs a strong online community around PCBWay, full of shared open-source hardware projects ‚Äî very inspiring!

## üß† Register Implementation on RAM

The design uses address-mapped RAM to support the CPU‚Äôs operation. This approach saves chip count, though at the cost of execution speed.

The following registers are implemented in RAM:
- Instruction Pointer
- Register A
- Carry Flag
- Equal Flag
- Index Register
- Stack Pointer
- The Stack

Here is the memory address map:

0000H - 17FFH Total RAM space
-----------------------------
* 0000H - 17FFH Total RAM space
* 0000H - 00FFH Stack
* 0100H - 17EF  Free for application
* 1FF0H SP      Stack Pointer 8 bit
* 1FF1H JSH     Temporary storage for JSR MSB address
* 1FF2H JSL          "       "     "   "  LSB    "
* 1FF3H XH      Index Register MSB
* 1FF4H XL      Index Register LSB
* 1FFAH E       bit<0> Equal Status bit
* 1FFBH C       bit<0> Carry Status bit
* 1FFCH A       Register
* 1FFEH IPH	    Instruction Pointer MSB
* 1FFFH IPL     Instruction Pointer MSB
* C000H         LED port
* E000H - F000H EEPROM for application program

## Microcode and Control ROMs

The ROM decoding table encodes how data moves between components.  
This reduces the number of control bits required by expanding microcode control using external PROMs.

- ROM chips: **IC20** and **IC21** (74S188, 256√ó1 Open Collector PROMs)
- These are *one-time programmable* PROMs.
- Several chips were sacrificed before the correct decoding table was finalized.

## I/O Board Schematic

Includes:
- RAM
- EEPROM (for application program)
- LEDs for visual feedback

## Debugging Setup

Early debugging involved **single clock stepping** and LEDs to display microcode address and main bus data.  
This was quickly found to be too tedious, leading to the acquisition of an **Agilent 1670G Logic Analyzer** (eBay bargain!).

- Logic analyzer connected to **MyCpu**
- Allows recording of instruction traces
- Symbol assignment enables **rudimentary microcode disassembly**

## üßµ Wire-Wrap Prototype

Before moving to a PCB, I built a **wire-wrap prototype** to test the design on real hardware. This stage was essential for debugging the microcode, verifying timing, and refining the instruction set.

Wire-wrapping made it easier to make changes during development while still providing a reliable and compact way to interconnect components.
